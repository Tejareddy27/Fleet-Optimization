Fleet Optimization and Carbon emission
Developed a model to optimize fleet composition for net-zero emissions by 2038 while minimizing costs. The project included creating mathematical models for fleet dynamics, considering vehicle purchase, disposal, fuel usage, and emissions tracking. Simulations tested various scenarios to ensure adaptability to changing conditions and regulations. The model offered recommendations balancing economic viability with environmental sustainability.
